# Uber Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on Uber trip data.  It aims to provide insights into trip patterns, demand fluctuations, and other relevant metrics.

## Features and Functionality

This project likely explores various aspects of Uber trip data, potentially including:

*   **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Cleaning the raw Uber trip data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and data type conversions.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and summarizing key features of the dataset, such as trip duration, distance, time of day, and location.
*   **Demand Forecasting:** Predicting future demand for Uber rides based on historical data.
*   **Trip Pattern Analysis:** Identifying popular routes, peak hours, and geographic hotspots of Uber activity.
*   **Data Visualization:** Presenting findings through charts, graphs, and maps to effectively communicate insights.

## Technology Stack

The project likely uses the following technologies:

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis and scripting.
*   **Pandas:** A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.  Used for loading, cleaning, and transforming the Uber trip data.
*   **NumPy:** A Python library for numerical computing. Used for mathematical operations on the data.
*   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Python libraries for creating visualizations.  Used to generate charts and graphs for EDA.
*   **Scikit-learn:** Python library for machine learning (potentially for demand forecasting).
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for data analysis and code execution.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1.  **Python:**  Version 3.7 or higher is recommended.  Check your Python version with `python --version` or `python3 --version`.

2.  **Pip:**  Python's package installer.  Ensure it's up-to-date: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

3.  **Required Python Packages:** Install the necessary libraries using pip.  A `requirements.txt` file should exist in the repository root folder (you'll likely need to create one if it does not exist to list the dependencies). Create this file manually by listing each package name followed by an equality sign and the version:

    ```
    pandas==1.5.3
    numpy==1.23.5
    matplotlib==3.7.1
    seaborn==0.12.2
    scikit-learn==1.2.2
    ```

    Then, install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If the `requirements.txt` does not exist, install the most common packages manually:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

## Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dhanashri2512/Uber-Data-Analysis.git
    cd Uber-Data-Analysis
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Follow the instructions in the Prerequisites section to install the required Python packages.

## Usage Guide

1.  **Open Jupyter Notebook:**

    Navigate to the project directory and start a Jupyter Notebook server:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Explore the Notebooks:**

    Open the relevant Jupyter Notebook files (e.g., `analysis.ipynb`, `eda.ipynb`, etc.) to explore the data analysis steps.  Execute the cells in the notebook to reproduce the results and visualizations.

3.  **Run Python Scripts (if applicable):**

    If the repository contains Python scripts (e.g., `.py` files), you can run them directly from the command line:

    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

    Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the script.
